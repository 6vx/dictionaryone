# Color Dictionary  

Collins Scrabble Dictionary "colored" by Magic the Gathering's [data](https://mtgjson.com/files/all-printings/) from [MTGJSON](MTGJSON.COM).

## About

Uses strings composed of stripped down Magic the Gathering card data as seeder data against Collin's Scrabble Dictionary word list. Uses multiple other data sources to further "saturate" word list.  

## Why

Because I think I'll see patterns that I enjoy.
